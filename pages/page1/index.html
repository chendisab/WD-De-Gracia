        <h2>Lunox</h2>
        <p>Lunox, the Twilight Goddess in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, commands both light and dark magic, embodying balance and chaos. Her passive, Dreamland Twist, allows her to switch between Order and Chaos states, each enhancing different abilities. With her first skill, Starlight Pulse (Order)/Chaos Assault (Chaos), Lunox releases energy that damages and penetrates enemies. Her second skill, Power of Order (Order)/Chaos Blink (Chaos), grants her mobility and enhances her next basic attack. Lunox's ultimate, Cosmic Fission, unleashes a burst of energy that deals damage in a wide area, scaling with her magic power. Born with the gift of dual magic, Lunox navigates a world where light and darkness vie for dominance. She seeks to maintain equilibrium, using her powers to thwart chaos and protect the realms from imbalance. Lunox's journey is a constant struggle to control her dual nature while striving to bring harmony to the Land of Dawn, where her presence is both feared and revered.</p>
