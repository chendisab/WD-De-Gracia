Her passive, Lakeshore Ambience, enhances her magic power after skill use. Avian Authority sends her swan forward to damage and slow enemies, while Blue Nova summons a swirling energy that damages and immobilizes foes. Her ultimate, Swan Song, creates a damaging symphony that slows enemies before culminating in a powerful explosion. Odette's journey began when dark forces threatened her homeland, prompting her to harness her elegant water-based magic to defend against the Abyssal Lord. She has since become a beacon of courage, forging alliances with other heroes to ensure peace prevails in the Land of Dawn.</p>
